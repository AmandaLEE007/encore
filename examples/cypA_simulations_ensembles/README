In this example we test the ability of ENCORE to calculate the
distance between three ensembles of the enzyme Cyclophilin A. Each
ensemble derives from the trajectory of an independent molecular
dynamics simulation, and a different force field was used for each
one:


traj_c22-star.xtc  	    : CHARMM22*
traj_c36.xtc		    : CHARMM36
traj_ff99sb-ildn-star.xtc   : AMBER99SB*-ILDN

In this example, we use the harmonic, clustering and dimensionality
reduction-based methods to estimate how much the ensembles sampled by
these force fields overlap. Running the examples, assuming that ENCORE
is correctly installed and that the set_environment.sh file is
properly set up, is just a matter of running the .sh files in the
directory (harmonic.sh, clustering.sh, dimred.sh), each of them using
one of the three methods detailed in the paper. You can take a look at
the comments in these files to understand how the commands work in
details.

IMPORTANT: Please run clustering.sh before dimred.sh. This is because clustering.sh
will save a the -RMSD matrix it uses as a file on disk, which is used in dimred.sh
so that it doesn't need to be recomputed.
