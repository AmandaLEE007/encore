In this example, the three measures of ensemble similarity implemented
in ENCORE (harmonic, clustering and dimensionality reduction) are
tested. In this case, we are comparing few different experimental
ensembles of  Ubiquitin resolved by different NMR methods with a
collection of crystal structures (xray.dcd). This example is inspired
by the article:

   Lange OF,Lakomek NA,Fares C,Schroder GF,Walter KF,et al. (2008)
   Recognition dynamics up to microseconds revealed from an RDC-derived
   ubiquitin ensemble in solution. Science 320: 1471â€“1475

in which a Residual Dipolar Couplings (RDC)-derived  ensemble of Ubiquitin
is compared with several other Ubiquitin experimental ensembles.

In a similar fashion,  we use our ensemble comparison
methods to compare several NMR-resolved ensembles, together with a
collection of X-ray structures. The NMR ensembles are:

DER: 1XQQ
EROS: 2K39
ERNST: 2KOX
SB: 2LJ5
MUMO: 2NR2

In this directory, three .sh files are present (harmonic.sh, clustering.sh
and dimred.sh). If the set_environment.sh file has been adequately set in the
 examples directory and ENCORE is correctly installed, they should be
completely automatical. The three scripts refer to three different methods
implemented in ENCORE: the harmonic similiarity measure (harmonic.sh),
that based on clustering (clustering.sh) and finally the method based
upon dimensionality reduction (dimred.sh).

Running the .sh scripts generates the correct command lines, which are then
run. 

IMPORTANT: Please run clustering.sh before dimred.sh. This is because
clustering.sh will save the -RMSD matrix as a file on disk. The
dimensionality reduction method (used in the script dimred.sh, ) loads
the matrix and changes the signs of its elements instead of
recomputing it from scratch, thus saving computational time.

Each script produces a log file which contains the output of the analysis:
one or or more matrices, which contain the values for the selected similarity
