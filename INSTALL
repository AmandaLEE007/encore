Installing ENCORE
=====================

ENCORE is written as a Python 2.6 library which interfaces to specialized C code in order to perform the most time-consuming operations. 
The prerequisites for installing ENCORE are:

	* A working python2.6 distribution or higher (2.X) 
	* the MDAnalysis package ( http://https://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/ )
	* a command-line C compiler (as gcc or clang)
	* Optionally, a working cython distribution
	
Installation happens through a standard distutils setup.py script. In order to install the library simply unpack the provided .tar.gz package, enter the unpacked directory and run:

	python setup.py install 

this performs a system-wide install, and administrative privileges may be required. It is possible however to select a custom location supplying the --prefix argument:

	python setup.py install --prefix=user_dir/location 

see 

	python setup.py install --help

for more details. Please notice the encore package directory MUST be in the python sys.path in order to work correctly. This is performed for instance by runnng this command in a bash shell:

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH":/location/of/encore"

you can add this line to your .bashrc or .profile file so that it's automatically executed after a shell is opened.
