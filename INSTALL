Installing ENCORE
=====================


Installation notes
--------------------

ENCORE is written as a Python 2.6 library which interfaces to specialized C code
in order to perform the most time-consuming operations. The C and the Python
parts are coupled through Cython wrappers. The prerequisites for installing
ENCORE are:

       * A working Python 2.6 distribution or higher (2.X)
       * the MDAnalysis package, version 0.8.1 or higher 
       	 ( http://https://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/ )
       * the scipy package, version 0.9 or higher. This is also
         a prerequisite for MDAnalysis.
       * a command-line C compiler (gcc or clang)
       * a working Cython distribution

Please notice that a working MDAnalysis installation must be available before
installing ENCORE, as the ENCORE installation script will fail if no
MDAnalysis is detected.


Easy installation steps
------------------------

Summing up, in order to install ENCORE from scratch, the following steps should be enough:

    	1.  Verify that you have a working Python installation, version 2.6 or
            higher. In order to do so, run:

               python --version

   	    if your python version is not compatible with ENCORE, please install
    	    or use another python version (for instance, the python2.6 or
    	    python2.7 executables might be available). In the following steps,
    	    always use the same python interpreter (choose one and stick with it).
    	    If you are on OSX and are using MacPorts Python distribution,
    	    it is advisable to always use python and Python tools (pip, easy_install,
    	    python) either from the MacPorts distribution OR from the distribution
    	    shipped with the operative systems. Mixing the two will not work.

	2.  Install the packages required for MDAnalysis. You can find the
    	    complete list here:

                http://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/wiki/Install#Additional_non-standard_packages

            Most packages are easily installed through your OS's package
       	    management system, and you really should rely on that if possible.
            However, if you don't have administrative privileges, you can install
            the packages locally in a more or less automatic way; if this is the
            case you can skip this step and go directly to step 3.

	3.  Install MDAnalysis. There are several possible ways of doing this, as
            listed on the MDAnalysis website
            (https://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/wiki/Install). If you are able to
            use your distribution's package management system, MDAnalysis can be
            installed as a normal binary package. See the MDAnalysis website for
            detailed instructions. If you prefer to install it locally instead, you
            can simply pip. Just run:

                pip install --user MDAnalysis

            these commands should download and install locally the requisites for
            MDAnalysis as well, allowing you to skip step 2 entirely. If this
            doesn't work as expected, you should download the MDAnalysis source
            code (https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/M/MDAnalysis/MDAnalysis-
            0.8.1.tar.gz#md5=a6f3a92c561822116124b09926296837) and install it
            manually, as detailed in the MDAnalysis website. This is performed by
            uncompressing downloaded the MDAnalysis .tar.gz, entering the
            MDAnalysis-0.8.1 directory and running:

                python setup.py install --user

            MDAnalysis need to be available to Python before installing ENCORE.

        4.  Install ENCORE. First, download the ENCORE installation package from github
            uncompress it:

      	        unzip ENCORE-1.0.zip

      	    then enter the directory that has been uncompressed (encore-master). If you
      	    want to install it system-wide, just run:

      	        python setup.py install

      	    if you want to install it locally, run instead:

                python setup.py install --user

            NOTICE: in some cases, the use of a latest Cython version generates
            C files that need to be compiled with gcc version 4.9 or higher. If the
            compilation fails, you may need to force setup.py to use the gcc-4.9


      	5.  After the installation is finished, the installation script will report
            the location of the installed ENCORE package, for instance:

      	        Installed /home/teo/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ENCORE-0.1b-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg

            Take note of the location. You will need it to set-up your calculations.
            It is useful to save this location in a system variable, for instance:

      	        export ENCORE=/home/teo/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ENCORE-0.1b-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg

      	6.  Go to your working directory (e.g. the directory where you want your
            work with ENCORE to be saved. Link ENCORE in your working directory:

      	        ln -s ${ENCORE}/encore/ .

      	7.  Run the similarity script from the encore directory:

      	        python encore/similarity.py --help

            The program should print the help information, meaning that ENCORE has been
            installed correctly.

Also notice that:

     * ENCORE should be installed using the same Python version as its
     prerequisites. This means that, for instance, if you install
     MDAnalysis and its prerequisites using Python 2.7, ENCORE must be
     installed using Python 2.7 as well. Otherwise, the installation of ENCORE
     will most likely fail. In most systems, it is just easier to use the
     default Python interpreter ("python").

     * As previously mentioned, the MDAnalysis installation directory needs be
     available to Python (i.e.
     in the PYTHONPATH) before installing ENCORE. The ENCORE installer checks
     for the availability of MDAnalysis and stops if it cannot find it. In
     order to check if MDAnalysis is available, just run the python version
     that we have used to install MDAnalysis (the "python" executable by
     default) and run "import MDAnalysis" at the Python interpreter command
     prompt. If no error shows up, you're good to go. This is most often the
     case if you have installed it as suggested here.  If the "No module
     named MDAnalysis" error is returned, you'll need to tell Python where to
     find the MDAnalysis module. This is done by adding the location of the
     MDAnalysis module to the system variable PYTHONPATH. For instance, you
     should run:

         export PYTHONPATH=/location/of/MDAnalysis/:$PYTHONPATH

     where /location/of/MDAnalysis/ is the location of the MDAnalysis module
     you have installed. The very same procedure can also be used to
     verify if the ENCORE module is available to Python, and, if not,
     you should add it to PYTHONPATH as well, exactly as explained
     here for MDAnalysis.

     you can add this "export" line to your .bashrc or .profile file so that
     it's automatically executed after a shell is opened.
