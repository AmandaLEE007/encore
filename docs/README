Encore documentation
=====================

The ENCORE reference documentation is automatically generated from 
the docstrings in the code, except for the Cython (.pyx) files and
the introduction, which have been added manually as rst files. 
In order to generate the documentation, you need: 

* the Sphinx package installed (see http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html)
* a LaTeX distribution, so that pdflatex is available 
* you have to build and install the ENCORE package in the  
  installation directory, by running:
      
      python setup.py develop --user

Then, to generate the documentation, you may run from here:

    make latexpdf

for the documentation in pdf format, and

    make html

for the documentation in the html format.

You can find the resulting files in the _build/latex or _build/html
directory. For your convenience, we have also provided a 
pre-compiled pdf file (encore-docs.pdf).
