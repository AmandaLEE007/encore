ENCORE EXAMPLES
=================

This directory contains the examples of running the ENCORE software. Two
examples are available, showcasing the two most important features of
ENCORE: the ability to calculate three different similarity measures
for protein ensembles as well as to give a rough estimate of the level
of convergence on an ensemble. The examples are found in the two
subdirectories available here (experimental_ubq_ensembles and
md_trajectory_convergence). In order to run the examples please follow
these steps:
 
- install ENCORE. Please refer to the INSTALL file in the main ENCORE
  installation for detailed instructions.

- each example is run through a simple bash script. The
  scripts need to have few system variables set up to work
  properly, which are set in the file set_environment.sh file in this
  directory. Therefore, you should modify the set_environment.sh file
  according to the location of ENCORE and MDAnalysis on your system
  and other details:

	* MDANALYSIS_BUILD: This is where the MDAnlaysis build is
          located. This is necessary only if MDAnalysis is not in your
          $PYTHONPATH.       

	* ENCORE_BUILD: This is where the ENCORE build is
          located. This is ALWAYS necessary (i.e. even if the ENCORE
          build is in your PYTHONPATH)
       
	* PYTHON: location of your python (2.6 or 2.7) executable 
	 Please use the same version that you have used to build ENCORE.

	* NP: number of cores that ENCORE will use its examples. On a
       	 modern computer running the ENCORE examples will take few
       	 minutes, even with a low number of cores (for instance 4).
	   
- Now you are ready to run the examples. They are contained in the three 
directories experimental_ubq_ensembles, md_trajectory_convergence and 
cypA_simulations_ensembles, each of them containing further instructions 
in the respective README file.
