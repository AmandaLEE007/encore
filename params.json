ENCORE can be used to compare experimental\r\nand simulation-derived ensembles, as well as estimate the convergence\r\nof trajectories from time-dependent simulations. The package was\r\ndesigned as a Python 2.6 (or any higher 2.X version) library. The user\r\nmay also use some of the library files as scripts that accept command\r\nline arguments. Usually, the help text included for each script\r\n(obtained running “python encore/script.py -h”) is\r\nself-explanatory. Examples are also available on how ENCORE may be\r\nused to calculate the similarity measures on a number of ensembles.\r\n\r\nThe similarity measures implemented in ENCORE are based on three\r\ndifferent methods, which all rely on the following idea: Given two or\r\nmore conformational ensembles of the same topology (i.e. structure),\r\nwe view the particular set of conformations from each ensemble as a\r\nsample from an underlying, but unknown, probability distribution. We\r\nuse this sample to model the probability density function of said\r\ndistribution. Then we compare the modeled distributions using standard\r\nmeasures of the similarity between two probability densities, such as\r\nthe Jensen-Shannon divergence.\r\n  \r\nIn the ENCORE package, we have implemented three methods to estimate\r\nthe density:\r\n\r\n* Harmonic ensembles similarity (HES): we assume that each ensemble is\r\n  derived from a multivariate normal distribution. We, thus, estimate\r\n  the parameters for the distribution of each ensemble (mean and\r\n  covariance matrix) and compare them using a symmetrized version of\r\n  the Kullback-Leibler divergence. For each ensemble, the mean\r\n  conformation is estimated as the average over the ensemble, and the\r\n  covariance matrix is calculated by default using a shrinkage\r\n  estimate method (or by a maximum-likelihood method, optionally).\r\n\r\n* Clustering-based similarity (CES): We use the affinity propagation\r\n  method for clustering to partition the whole space of conformations\r\n  in to clusters of structures. After the structures are clustered we\r\n  take the population of each ensemble in each cluster as a\r\n  probability distribution of conformations. We then compare the\r\n  obtained probability distribution using the Jensen-Shannon\r\n  divergence measure between probability distributions.\r\n\r\n* Dimensionality reduction-based similarity (DRES): We use a gaussian\r\n  kernel-based density estimation method to estimate the probability\r\n  density, and use that as probability function in order to compare\r\n  different ensembles. Before doing that, however, due to the limited\r\n  size of the sample, it is necessary to reduce the dimensionality of\r\n  the input space. Thus, the method first projects the ensembles into\r\n  lower dimensions by using the Stochastic Proximity Embedding\r\n  algorithm.\r\n\r\nENCORE is able to use, as input data, structural ensembles deriving\r\nboth from molecular simulations (e.g. molecular dynamics or Monte\r\nCarlo methods) or experimental structural ensembles (e.g. NMR\r\nstructures as PDB files). The software is able to handle the most\r\npopular trajectory formats (files such as DCD, XTC, TRR, XYZ, TRJ,\r\nMDCRD), although periodic boundaries conditions must be removed before\r\nuse. A topology file is also required.\r\n\r\nTogether with the software, we also provide three examples that\r\nshowcase three typical cases of study:\r\n\r\n* comparing simulation trajectories with other trajectories \r\n* estimating convergence of trajectories from molecular dynamics simulations\r\n* comparing  experimentally-derived ensembles from the PDB\r\n\r\nSee the examples themselves for more information.\r\nIf you use ENCORE for your scientific work, please cite:\r\n\r\n>   Matteo Tiberti, Elena Papaleo, Tone Bengtsen, Wouter Boomsma and\r\n>   Kresten Lindorff-Larsen,\r\n>   ENCORE: Software for quantitative ensemble comparison\r\n>   Submitted\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
