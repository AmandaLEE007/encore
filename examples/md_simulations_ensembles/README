In this example, we show the application of ENCORE to calculate the
similarity measures between three ensembles from molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. Each ensemble derives from the
trajectory of an independent molecular simulation, and a
different force field was used for each of them:


traj_c22-star.xtc           : CHARMM22*
traj_c36.xtc                : CHARMM36
traj_ff99sb-ildn-star.xtc   : AMBER99SB*-ILDN

In this example, we use the harmonic, clustering and dimensionality
reduction-based methods to estimate how much the ensembles sampled by
these force fields overlap. Running the examples, assuming that ENCORE
is correctly installed and that the set_environment.sh file is
properly set up, is just a matter of running the .sh files in the
directory (harmonic.sh, clustering.sh, dimred.sh), each of them using
one of the three methods detailed in the paper. You can look at
the comments in these files to understand how the commands work in
details.

IMPORTANT: Please run clustering.sh before dimred.sh. This is because
clustering.sh will save the -RMSD matrix as a file on disk. The
dimensionality reduction method (used in the script dimred.sh, ) loads
the matrix and changes the signs of its elements instead of
recomputing it from scratch, thus saving computational time.
