In this example, we demonstrate how the three
measures of ensemble similarity implemented in ENCORE (HES, CES and
DRES) can be used to compare ensembles obtained by combining
experiments and simulations. We do so by comparing few different
experimental ensembles of  Ubiquitin resolved by different NMR methods
with a collection of crystal structures (xray.dcd).

In particular the ensemble comparison methods are used to compare
several NMR-resolved ensembles, together with a collection of X-ray
structures. The NMR ensembles were all obtained from the PDB:

DER: 1XQQ
EROS: 2K39
ERNST: 2KOX
SB: 2LJ5
MUMO: 2NR2

In this directory, three .sh files are present (hes.sh, ces.sh and
dres.sh). If the set_environment.sh file has been adequately set in
the examples directory and ENCORE is correctly installed, they should
be completely automatic. The three scripts refer to three different
methods implemented in ENCORE: the harmonic similiarity measure
(harmonic.sh), that based on clustering (ces.sh) and finally the
method based upon dimensionality reduction (dres.sh).

Running the .sh scripts generates the correct command lines, which are
then run.

IMPORTANT: Please run ces.sh before dres.sh. This is because
ces.sh will save the -RMSD matrix as a file on disk. The
dimensionality reduction method (used in the script dres.sh) loads
the matrix and changes the signs of its elements instead of
recomputing it from scratch, thus saving computational time.

Each script produces a log file which contains the output of the analysis:
one or more matrices, which contain the values for the selected similarity
 ensemble measure between each ensemble and each other.

The values in the output matrices are in the same order with which the input
files are provided to the program, which is the following:

      DER, EROS, ERNST, SB, MUMO, X-ray

This means that the values in the output matrix are to be interpreted
as follows:

       	   DER  EROS  ERNST   SB    MUMO   X-ray
 DER   	   0.0  0.1   0.4     ...
 EROS  	   0.1  0.0   0.3
 ERNST	   ...
 SB    	   
 MUMO
 X-ray
