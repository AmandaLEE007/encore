ENCORE EXAMPLES
=================

This directory contains three examples of how the ENCORE software may
be used. Together these examples demonstrate how to use the two most
important features of ENCORE:

(i) to calculate the three different similarity measures (HES, CES and DRES)
for protein ensembles, either from molecular simulations or from
experiments and  
(ii) to use such calculations to provide an estimate of  
the rate of convergence of a molecular simulation. 

The examples are found in the three subdirectories:
md_simulations_ensembles, experimental_ubq_ensembles and
md_trajectory_convergence. In order to run the examples please follow
these steps:
 
- install ENCORE. Please refer to the INSTALL file in the main ENCORE
  installation for detailed instructions.

- each example is run through a simple bash script. The
  scripts need to have few system variables set up to work
  properly, which are set in the file set_environment.sh file in this
  directory. Therefore, you should modify the set_environment.sh file
  according to the location of ENCORE and MDAnalysis on your system
  and other details:

      * MDANALYSIS_BUILD: This is where the MDAnalysis build is
      	located. This is necessary only if MDAnalysis is not in your
      	$PYTHONPATH.  	  

      * ENCORE_BUILD: This is where the ENCORE build is
      	located. This is ALWAYS necessary (i.e. even if the ENCORE
      	build is in your PYTHONPATH)
  	 
      * PYTHON: location of your python (2.6 or 2.7) executable
     	 Please use the same version that you have used to build ENCORE.

      * NP: number of cores that ENCORE will use its examples. Certain
        calculations within ENCORE, such as the calculation of the
        pairwise RMSDs between a large number of structures, can be
        slow, and ENCORE allows such calculations to be parallelized
        over multiple cores if these are present.

- Now you are ready to run the examples. They are contained in the three
  directories experimental_ubq_ensembles, md_trajectory_convergence and
  md_simulations_ensembles, each of them containing further instructions
  in the respective README file.
